### FIND USER COUNTRY BY IP

In this task I implement a simple REST API using the Express framework. The essence of the API is to detect user's ip
address and country of origin.

To run the app:

Compile the app (Windows)

```bash
tsc.cmd
```

Compile the app (Unix)

```bash
tsc
```

Start the app:

```bash
node ./src/index.js
```
